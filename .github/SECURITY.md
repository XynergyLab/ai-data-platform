# Security Policy

## Introduction

The AI and Data Processing Platform treats security as a top priority. This document outlines our security policies, including how to report vulnerabilities, our response process, and best practices for secure deployment and usage of the platform.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0 | :x:                |

Once a major version reaches end-of-life, we will notify users at least 3 months in advance and provide migration guides to supported versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain the security of our platform. If you discover a security vulnerability, we kindly request that you report it to us through one of the following channels:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: We prefer you use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/XynergyLab/ai-data-platform/security/advisories/new) feature
- **Email**: For critical issues, you can also email us directly at security@xynergylabs.com with "[AI-PLATFORM-SECURITY]" in the subject line

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. A detailed description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact assessment
4. Any possible mitigations you've identified
5. Whether you would like to be credited for the discovery (and if so, how)

## Response Timeframe

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours, you will receive an acknowledgment of your report
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days, we will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability
- **Remediation Timeline**: Within 14 days of validation, we will provide an expected timeline for a fix

Critical vulnerabilities will be prioritized and addressed more rapidly.

## Disclosure Policy

Our disclosure policy follows these principles:

1. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with reporters to ensure vulnerabilities are fixed before public disclosure
2. **Credit**: We will acknowledge those who report valid security issues, unless they request anonymity
3. **Public Disclosure**: After a fix is released, we will publish a security advisory with details about the vulnerability and mitigation steps

We typically follow a 90-day disclosure deadline, but this may be extended or shortened based on the severity of the vulnerability and the time needed to develop and deploy a fix.

## Security Best Practices

### Container Security

- Always use the latest container images from our official GHCR registry
- Regularly scan container images using Trivy or similar tools
- Implement least-privilege access policies for container execution
- Do not expose container management APIs to the internet

### Application Security

- Use API keys with appropriate scope limitations
- Enable TLS for all connections between services
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for all endpoints
- Regularly rotate credentials and access keys

### Data Security

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement access controls for vector databases
- Use secure methods for storing and handling model weights
- Regularly backup data with encrypted backups

### Infrastructure Security

- Use isolated networks for different service categories
- Implement network policies to restrict traffic between services
- Enable monitoring and logging for all components
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities

### Compliance

- Review our compliance documentation in the `docs/compliance/` directory
- Ensure your deployment meets data protection regulations relevant to your jurisdiction
- Keep audit logs for all sensitive operations

## Security-Related Configuration

The platform includes several security-focused configuration options:

- Authentication providers in `ai-services/*/config/*.json`
- Network isolation settings in `global-compose.yaml`
- Encryption settings in various service configurations

Please refer to the documentation for each service for detailed security configuration options.

## Security Updates

We announce security updates through:

1. GitHub Security Advisories
2. Release notes
3. Our official Slack channel (for critical updates)
